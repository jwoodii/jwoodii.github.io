##Designing the World

  A common question in interviews for ICS positions is "What are Design Patterns?" and "What patterns have you used?". Considering how short a time I have spent programming, it's honestly still more of a question of "What the HELL are you doing?" however I have made use of some of the more basic patterns. A quick wikipedia search shows that there is a list of classifications and grouping. Honestly I have never heard of these refered to with such a name before. However I have made some use of them in the few short years I have spent coding so far. Before that lets go over what a design pattern is.
 
 A design pattern in simple terms is a generic solution for a commonly occuring problem in programming. It is not a program structure like Binary Tree and the like but something like a module where you group similar objects variables and other things into a single entity. There are of course other examples but the general idea is that a design pattern refers to a way to solve a problem that comes up a lot. another example is a null object where instead of having something point to null you instead have it point to a default object. This helps to avoid null pointer exceptions and errors and makes it easier to tell exactly what wasn't initialized properly.

  Honestly I haven't used many design patterns, at least that I know of, in my projects. one that I know I have used is Lock where only one user can edit it, as well as Read-Write Lock, where only one can edit but others can read. I used both in 212 when we went over SCCS. another one was Dependency Injection where the object required for a function is passed into rather than created by the function. This one I used a lot with the final group project for 314. We did a lot of this just because it would be easier to create the object before hand or it was already existed than to have it created in the function.

  Honestly I haven'y had much experience with design patterns and it is certainly an area to be improved upon. I hope that one of the class I take will go over in more depth about this since it seems to be a really helpful thing to have. It is definitely something that I will look into further even without a specific class.

## Fashionable Coding	

Coding style I feel is one of the simplest and easiest changes one can make that will definitely help improve one’s coding. It helped me find bugs in my code faster and makes my code much easier to read, for me and other who might read it.  

It truly is one of the simplest changes one can make when one is coding as it is simple. Most IDE come with a built-in code style to use and if not, you can always make your own. In my own experience trying to get the code checker to work was always the hard part. I found it especially hard this time around as ESLint was especially wonky for me. For some reason it has 2 sets and I must enable both for it to work. And I also must disable and then re-enable it. However, being able to just hit a few keys and watch my code instantly format itself is honestly very satisfying. While it is a pain to have to enable it every time I think it will naturally become habit for me by the end. Another interesting thing is that although ESLint is supposed to recognize underscore command with the way I have it setup, it just doesn’t. this makes getting a “Green check” a very big pain and basically impossible. It only after I fiddle with the settings that it works. Of course it always something different every single time but Oh well.

Honestly though I feel that coding style is something very basic and very simple to learn but at the same time very difficult to implement. If I had to try and do it one by one every single time it would be a major pain in the butt. I might wind up just not doing it for smaller programs where I only have one or two files for it. However even if I did have to do it one by one, for the bigger programs where I will be constantly rereading the file I would take the time to fix it. This would also go for program I would need to let other read the code for it, just so that they understand better. Outside of that though thank god there is an automatic formatter and a command for it as well. All in all though I spent all my programming class having to format my code so its nothing new but definitely worth the time it took to learn it.

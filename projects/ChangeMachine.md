summary: Tell you how many coins to give for change
---

  This was one of the first Projects I did as a freshman coming first starting computer programming. of course, this is super easy now that Iâ€™ve gone through a few more computer programming classes this is still the first major project I did as a computer programmer, so it has a lot of sentimental value. It functions as a change maker. It tells you how many coins (Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, Pennies) to give as change given an amount.

  This was done probably after 2 or 3 weeks of learning basic java in ICS 111. This while not being the most complicated or even difficult things to program, it still stands out to me as the first step I took in being a programmer. I learned a lot just about how a program should flow and how I should think about the program as a series of steps that need to be repeated to get what you want done. Still super proud of this simple one.

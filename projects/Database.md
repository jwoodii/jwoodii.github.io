summary: As a project for ICS 212 we were had to create an account database.
---

  In ICS 212 we learned C and C++, and one of the very first few homework’s we did was to create a database using C. when we first began we just made the menu and used stubs for the methods. After that while doing other homework’s we eventually came back to the database doing pseudo code for the methods and slowly building up the database. Eventually we did our first project on making the complete database. We came back to it after we started learning C++. Eventually starting project 2 we had to rebuild the database in C++, using project 1 as a base. 
  
  Considering this was one of the larger projects that basically was built upon all semester in the class, it holds a special sentiment to me in that it took many hours and much hair pulling to get it done. In the end it holds sentimental value to me and is probably one of the few projects I have worked on for a long period of time. I learned a lot with this one, specifically to always check my parentheses and curly braces. This one was a lot of fun and I hope to be able to make more like these in the future.
